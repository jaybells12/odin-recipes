      <li>
        Heat oven to 425°F. Prepare pie crusts as directed on box for Two-Crust
        Pie using 9-inch glass pie pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion; cook 2
        minutes, stirring frequently, until tender. Stir in flour, salt and
        pepper until well blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk, cooking and
        stirring until bubbly and thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken and mixed vegetables. Remove from heat. Spoon chicken
        mixture into crust-lined pan. Top with second crust; seal edge and
        flute. Cut slits in several places in top crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until crust is golden brown. During last 15 to
        20 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent
        excessive browning. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
